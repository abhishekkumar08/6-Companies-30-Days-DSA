## Explantion

- We would simulate the process of climbing a mountain and goin down the mountain.
- Firstly we would traverse the array
- If the current element is greater than the previous element, we would increment the count of the mountain
- After reaching the peak we would simulate the downhill and then find the maximum length of the mountain
